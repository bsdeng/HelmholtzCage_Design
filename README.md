# Optimal Design of the Square Shaped Helmholtz-Cage

## Code
To compute the optimal parameter values, just run these commands on your terminal \
```
pip install -r requirements.txt \
python helmholtz_cage.py \
```

The module includes a high-resolution ```QMC5883L``` magnetometer sensor.
The ```I2C``` serial bus is through the two-wire ```I2C``` synchronous serial interface.

## I - Features
- The Honeywell HMC5883L is a surface-mount, multi-chip module designed for low-field magnetic sensing with a digital interface for applications such as low cost compassing and magnetometry
- The 12-Bit ADC coupled with low noise AMR sensors achieves 5 milli-gauss field resolution in Â±8 gauss fields
- Low voltage operations and low power consumption; supports built-in self-test
- Built-in strap drive circuits, I2C digital interface, wide magnetic field range (+/-8 oe)
- Working voltage: 3.3v-5v; PCB size: 1.3 x 2.3 cm (HMC5883L size: 3.0 x 3.0 x 0.9 mm), with a16-pin leadless chip carrier (LCC)
